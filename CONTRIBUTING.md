# Contributing

## Finding an Issue

Issue labels are used to track various tasks. The labels can describe priority, type, and status of each issue.

Labels may also be used to search for issues you would like to work on. The following labels are open to contributions:

- **Issues available for community contribution:**
  - `good first issue`: Open to participation from the community and welcome to new contributors
  - `help wanted`: Open to participation from the community and not necessarily beginner-friendly

No explicit permission is needed to start working on these types of issues.

You can [find issue labels here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/go-cnc/labels) to see what matches your skills and familiarity with the project.

## Contribution Process

If you've found an issue you would like to work on, follow these steps to make your contribution:

1. Comment on the issue to claim. This avoids potential conflicts with others also interested in the issue.
        - It is recommended to tag the user who opened the issue and ask that the issue gets assigned to you.
2. Write your code and submit your pull request when ready. Link to the related issue.
3. Wait for code review and address any questions as soon as you can.

**Collaboration is encouraged**: If someone has claimed an issue you were interested in, contributors may review each other's pull requests. We appreciate contributors that collaborate in a kind, constructive manner.

## Creating a New Issue

Before creating a new issue, please search the GitHub repository for similar issues that have already been posted.

If you want to work on something that has no existing GitHub issue, follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub issue to propose your changes. Identify the problem that your issue addresses. Explain your steps for implementation and rationale for the proposed changes.
   - We are reluctant to accept pull requests with no related issue created first.

2. Wait for the project maintainer to review and approve your issue for accepting pull requests.

3. If your issue has been approved, you may self-assign the issue and start work on code, following the [Contribution Process](#contribution-process).
